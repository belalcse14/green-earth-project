# Answer to the following questions:

#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

# ANS:

_var_ is function-scoped, allowing re-assignment, but it is generally avoided in modern JavaScript.
_let_ is block-scoped, allows re-assignment
_const_ is also block-scoped, cannot be re-assigned

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

# ANS:

- _forEach()_ is for performing an action on each element without creating a new array.
- _map()_ is for transforming each element and creating a new array with the transformed values.
- _filter()_ is for selecting elements based on a condition and creating a new array with the selected elements.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

# ANS:

- Arrow functions in ES6 are a shorter and cleaner way to write functions in JavaScript.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

# ANS:

- Variables are declared within square brackets [] and assigned values based on their position in the array being destructured.

  const [first, second, third] = [10, 20, 30];

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

# ANS:

- String Concatenation requires (\n) characters for line breaks in multi-line strings, whereas template literals allow natural line breaks within the backticks.
